Done. The author name on a `SocialMediaCard` links to the source, as requested.

Please note the following:

1) Not all medias are linked to sources. Examples: Images and Claims
2) Medias can be originally be linked to sources and become 'sourceless' if related `account` is removed from `source`.
3) Media author name may not correspond to Source name, and there's no visual cue (other than subtle status bar url tip) implying that name links to `source` or external network profile.
4) If more than one `source` has a same `account`, it can be difficult to tell which `source` will be linked.
5) There's no link to `source` on the media detail page, because it renders the original media embed.

waiting:
--------

needs fix:
----------
- UpdateDynamicMutation should have a parent_type and return a getFatQuery value based on that value? As in CreateDynamicMutation
- project_source `updated_at` field doesn't get updated when source is annotated with comment (#6111)
- Link Source name on SocialMedia cards to Source Page

needs refactor:
---------------
- SourceCard.js:69: MediaUtil.socialIcon(account.node.provider + '.com')
- CommentCard as component
- Layout to spec (chiclet buttons in create media #6106)
- Create Unit Test for ProfileLink
- SourceLanguages (Relay.RootContainer)

questions?
----------
How to test component with Link? It depends on react-router

Not sure if expected behaviour

- Create a source from a website URL
- Add a link to page from that website
- Pender extracted a new source from that page
- New media belongs to new source rather than first one

suggestions
-----------
- remove `data` field (ruby notation) from account_type?
- rename `embed` field to `scraped` ?
